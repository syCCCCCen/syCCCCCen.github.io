About Me
======
I'm Siyuan Cen (岑思远), a first year master at [UMASS Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), supervised by Prof. [Chuang Gan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/). Before that, I received my bachelor degree from [Nanjing University]() in 2024, where I'm lucky to work closely with Prof. [Ying Tai](https://tyshiwo.github.io/).

My research focuses on Computer Vision, Robotics and Embodied AI. Currently I'm working on 3D motion diffusion generation.
