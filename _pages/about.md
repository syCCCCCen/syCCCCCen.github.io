About Me
=====
I'm **Siyuan Cen (岑思远)**, a first year master at [UMASS Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), supervised by Prof. [Chuang Gan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/). Before that, I received my bachelor degree from [Nanjing University]() in 2024, where I'm lucky to work closely with Prof. [Ying Tai](https://tyshiwo.github.io/).

My research centers on Computer Vision, Robotics, and Embodied AI, with a long-term goal of enabling machines to perceive, interpret, and act upon information, overcoming the limitations of various modalities.

Current Research

Currently I'm working on **video diffusion generation**. Specificly, my interest focuses on **camera control human video**.
